# OSU AI Bootcamp - Challenge 6 - Data Sourcing Challenge
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
The task was to complete a jupyter notebook where we pulled data from the New York Times reviews API first, then joined that with data we pulled from a movie information database API.  That joined data was put into a dataframe, cleaned up, and exported to a CSV.
## Files
- retrieve_movie_data.ipynb is the main file where the assignment is completed.
- output.csv is the requested aggregated and cleaned data output.
- The "output" folder and the contents were provided by the lab assignment but not used for the solution.
